## Minneapolis Police Stops

```{r}

  group_by(neighborhood) %>%

         total_sus = sum(problem == "suspicious"),

  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-total_sus) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_stops))

mpls_suspicious

```

```{r}
mpls_nbhd <- st_read("Minneapolis_Neighborhoods/Minneapolis_Neighborhoods.shp", quiet = TRUE)

mpls_all <- mpls_nbhd %>% 
  left_join(mpls_suspicious,
            by = c("BDNAME" = "neighborhood")) %>% 
  left_join(MplsDemo, 
            by = c("BDNAME" = "neighborhood"))
```

```{r, fig.alt = "Map showing the proportion of stops that were suspicious by Minneapolis neighborhood."}
sus_pal <- colorNumeric("viridis",
                    domain = mpls_all$prop_sus,
                    reverse = TRUE)

leaflet(mpls_all) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner) %>% 
  addPolygons(
    stroke = FALSE, 
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    fillColor = ~sus_pal(prop_sus),
    label = ~BDNAME) %>% 
  addLegend(pal = sus_pal,
          values = ~prop_sus,
          opacity = 0.5,
          title = "Proportion Suspicious",
          position = "bottomright")
  
```
The proportion of police stops for suspicious behavior is much smaller on the south side of Minneapolis, and is much lower in the northern regions near Lauderdale. I notice that many neighborhoods that I know to have more white, high-income residents tend to have a lower proportion of stops for suspicious behavior.

```{r, fig.alt = "Map showing the household income by Minneapolis neighborhood. Darker colors indicate higher income."}
income_pal <- colorNumeric("viridis",
                    domain = mpls_all$hhIncome,
                    reverse = TRUE)

leaflet(mpls_all) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner) %>% 
  addPolygons(
    stroke = FALSE, 
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    fillColor = ~income_pal(hhIncome),
    label = ~BDNAME) %>% 
  addLegend(pal = income_pal,
          values = ~hhIncome,
          opacity = 0.5,
          title = "Household Income",
          position = "bottomright")
```
This map shows the distribution of household income across Minneapolis neighborhoods. Higher income neighborhoods tend to be on the outskirts of town, particularly on the southwest side north of Bloomington. Low income neighborhoods tend to be closer to the city center near the highway.

## Bike Rental by Time
