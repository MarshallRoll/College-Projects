## Introduction to Statistical Modelling (STAT 155)

#### Background

Universities in the United States are traditionally very expensive, so cost acts a barrier to higher education for many prospective students. Several programs, such as the Pell Grant, aim to provide financial aid to students from low-income families to decrease the cost of attending these institutions. Furthermore, these programs are designed to allow first-generation students to have better educational opportunities.

#### Project Description

The goal of this paper is to find the relationship between the average student’s family income at a given university and the proportion of first generation students and students receiving a Pell Grant at that university. If programs like the Pell Grant are effective, we expect universities with a higher population of first generation and Pell-recipient students to have lower average family incomes. Specifically, we endeavor to find the relationship between the proportion of first generation students and the proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant to the average student’s family income at a given university through linear regression.



### Evaluating Financial Aid Efficacy Relative to the Federal Poverty Line

#### Project Description

The goal of this paper is to determine whether financial aid programs direct funds to students who need it the most, building on our previous paper. If programs like the Pell Grant are effective, we expect universities with a higher percent of first-generation and Pell-recipient students to have higher odds of having average family incomes below the poverty line. Specifically, we endeavor to find the relationship between the percent of first generation students and the percent of students receiving a Pell Grant to the odds of average family income being above the federal poverty line for a family of 4 ($26,200/year) through logistic regression.
