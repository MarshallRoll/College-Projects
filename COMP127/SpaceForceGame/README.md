Space Force is a game that lets users maneuver a spaceship around the screen while trying to avoid asteroids. Players get three lives, which are lost if the spaceship is hit by an asteroid. The goal is to survive as long as possible!

#### File Download

To play Space Force, download the zip file for the entire repository and open the SpaceForce folder in an IDE like VSCode. Run SpaceForceGame.java and a canvas object should pop up on the screen. 

#### How to play

To move the spaceship, users can press W to move forward, A to move left, S to move right, D to move backward, and space bar to shoot. Users can move the spaceship around the screen, and when it goes off the edge it will reappear on the opposite side of the canvas. Players have three lives, and if an asteroid hits the spaceship, players will lose a life and must replay the level. Lives left will be displayed at the end of every round.
