Breakout is a game in which a user tries to break bricks by aiming a ball with a paddle in order to "break out" of a confined space. The user has three lives to break all the bricks without letting the ball go past the paddle. 

#### File Download

To play Breakout, download the zip file for the entire repository and open the Breakout folder in an IDE like VSCode. Run BreakoutGame.java and a canvas object should pop up on the screen. 

#### How to play

To move the paddle, users can press A to move left and S to move right. Users can move the paddle horizontally trying to keep the ball from passing the paddle and going off the screen. If the ball does goes off the edge, a life will be lost and the ball will respawn in a position above the paddle after a short grace period. Players have three lives, so be careful!
