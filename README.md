Game in which users shoot asteroids while manuevering a spaceship around the screen. Players complete levels of increasing difficulty with three lives, losing a life each time the spaceship comes into contact with an asteroid. Game ends when all three lives are lost. Written in Java to practice object-oriented computer programming concepts.
