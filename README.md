# College Projects
### by Marshall Roll, Macalester College

Completed projects from various college classes. These include:

## Object-Oriented Programming (COMP 127)

#### Space Force 
* Game in which users shoot asteroids while manuevering a spaceship around the screen. Players complete levels of increasing difficulty with three lives, losing a life each time the spaceship comes into contact with an asteroid. Game ends when all three lives are lost. Written in Java to practice object-oriented computer programming concepts. 

#### Breakout 
* Game in which users break bricks by aiming a ball with a paddle. Players must break all bricks without letting the ball exit the screen, with three lives to do so. Game ends when all three lives are lost or player breaks out successfully. Written in Java to practice object-oriented computer programming concepts. 

## Introduction to Statistical Modelling (STAT 155)

#### Evaluating Financial Aid Efficacy
* Project which seeks to find the relationship between the proportion of first generation students and the proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant to the average studentâ€™s family income at a given university. Uses linear regression modelling in R and the college scorecard dataset to obtain university-level data.

#### Evaluating Financial Aid Efficacy Relative to the Federal Poverty Line
* Project which seeks to find the relationship between the percent of first generation students and the percent of students receiving a Pell Grant to the odds of average family income being above the federal poverty line for a family of 4 ($26,200/year). Uses logistic regression modelling in R and the college scorecard dataset to obtain university-level data.
