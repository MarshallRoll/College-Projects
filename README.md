# College Projects
### by Marshall Roll, Macalester College

Completed projects from various college classes. These include:

## Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 253)

#### Modeling Platelet Levels and Stroke Events
* Project which seeks to use statistical machine learning techniques in R to shed light on the underlying factors that are connected to stroke events. Divided into three major sections: predicting platelet levels, a factor related to stroke events, using regression techniques, predicting whether individuals are likely to have a stroke or not using classification techniques, and uncovering other important patterns in the data using clustering.

## Object-Oriented Programming (COMP 127)

#### Space Force 
* Game in which users shoot asteroids while manuevering a spaceship around the screen. Players complete levels of increasing difficulty with three lives, losing a life each time the spaceship comes into contact with an asteroid. Game ends when all three lives are lost. Written in Java to practice object-oriented computer programming concepts. 

#### Breakout 
* Game in which users break bricks by aiming a ball with a paddle. Players must break all bricks without letting the ball exit the screen, with three lives to do so. Game ends when all three lives are lost or player breaks out successfully. Written in Java to practice object-oriented computer programming concepts. 

## Introduction to Statistical Modelling (STAT 155)

#### Evaluating Financial Aid Efficacy
* Project which seeks to find the relationship between the proportion of first generation students and the proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant to the average studentâ€™s family income at a given university. Uses linear regression modelling in R and the college scorecard dataset to obtain university-level data.

#### Evaluating Financial Aid Efficacy Relative to the Federal Poverty Line
* Project which seeks to find the relationship between the percent of first generation students and the percent of students receiving a Pell Grant to the odds of average family income being above the federal poverty line for a family of 4 ($26,200/year). Uses logistic regression modelling in R and the college scorecard dataset to obtain university-level data. 

## Introduction to Data Science (STAT 112)

#### Movie Recommender
* Website that allows users to explore a large dataset of movies released in the last century across lanugages and genres. Provides strong data visualizations to depict analytics and also recommends movies based on selected genres. Created using Shiny, an R package that allows users to build interactive web apps.

#### Data Visualization Portfolio
* A portfolio of data visualizations created in RStudio using a variety of R packages, including ggplot, leaflet, and patchwork. 

## Linear Algebra (MATH 236)

#### Problem Sets
* Various problem sets completed in RStudio to practice linear algebra concepts such as eigenvectors and eigenvalues, projection onto subspaces, Fourier Analysis, regression modeling, and stochastic matrices.
